#### Extracurricular Activities
- **Cornell Rocketry Team**  
  *Team Lead*
  
  July 2025 - June 2026  
  - Leading a 60 member team developing an HTPB/nitrous hybrid rocket for IREC 2026 and a proof of concept of the team’s first regeneratively cooled liquid engine
  - Designed low-cost filament winder for manufacturing fiberglass and carbon fiber airframes in-house


  *Structures Lead*
  
  July 2024 - June 2026
  - Designed airframe, owned system-level mechanical integration, stability and mass budget, and aerodynamic analysis for the team’s first hybrid rocket
  - Directed structural design and integration efforts for a 10-member team as Structures Lead, contributing to a third-in-category finish at IREC 2025 (Hybrid 10k SRAD)
  - Reduced airframe manufacturing lead time by 80% by overhauling procedure


  *Composites Lead*
  
  September 2023 - June 2024
  - Reworked manufacturing timeline and led airframe preparation alongside Structures leads, including quick recovery from a catastrophic failure at a late spring test launch


  *Drogue Separation System Owner*
  
  September 2023 - June 2024
  - Led drogue separation system redesign for 2024 rocket: designed and built piston-based system that uses ~85% less black powder than standard mechanism, designed and executed electro-mechanical tests to ensure function


  *Structures Subteam New Member*
  
  October 2022 - August 2023
  - Learned how to use industry standard tools for mechanical design (SolidWorks, Matlab)
  - Machined mill and lathe parts for 2023 flight and hybrid test stand 
  - Contributed to airframe manufacturing process and led surface prep for flight in the spring
